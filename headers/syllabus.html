                <h3>What is this class about?</h3>
                <p>
                    Big data is everywhere. A fundamental goal across numerous modern businesses and sciences is to be able to utilize as many machines as possible, to consume as much information as possible and as fast as possible. The big challenge is "how to turn data into useful knowledge".
                    This is a moving target as both the underlying hardware and our ability to collect data evolve. In this class, we will discuss how to design big data systems, data structures and algorithms for key data-driven areas, including distributed systems, Parallel systems, graph systems, 
                    SQL/noSQL, machine learning and neural networks. We will see how they all rely on the same set of very basic concepts and we will learn how to synthesize efficient solutions for any problem across these areas using those basic concepts.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>What is a big data system?</h3>
                <p>
                    Data systems are literally everywhere. We are using them directly or indirectly every day all day long for numerous basic or not so basic tasks, e.g., when we are buying coffee to when we are booking airplane tickets or training a neural network. 
                    They provide the backbone of all modern businesses to manage their data and of course they provide the backbone of online businesses and environments such as social networks and search engines. 
                    They are also used increasingly in science as data analytics becomes more and more the fundamental barrier in generating knowledge.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>What is this class NOT about?</h3>
                <p>
                    This class is not a traditional introduction on how we use a database system and how to write SQL. Instead, this is a systems class about data system design. 
                    You will learn how big data systems work at their core and how to design new systems for emerging data- driven applications and hardware By the way, if you know how systems work, you also become better at using them!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Why take this class?</h3>
                <p>
                    Data is everywhere. Every year we create even more data. As it stands, every two days we create as much data as much we created from the dawn of humanity up to 2003. Sciences, businesses, and everyday life are substantially affected. Data systems are in the middle of all this. Data systems are how we store and access data, i.e., they are the backbone of any data-driven application. It is a $100B industry, growing 10% every year [Economist, “Data, data everywhere”].

                    At the same time big data systems research and the whole industry are going through a major and continuous transition; given that new data-driven scenarios and applications continuously pop up, there is a continuous need to redefine what is a good data system design in such a dynamic environment.

                    DS5110 exposes students to the core internals of big data systems making it possible to understand core trends in system design and to be one of the few who know how to design and evaluate systems. In addition, due to the way the course is taught (focus on interactive problem solving, open topics and the latest research results) this is also a great class for those who want to understand what CS research is all about and how to engage in doing research.

                <h3>Class Philosophy</h3>
                <p>
                    DS5110 has unlimited office hours, unlimited late days for project deliverables, relies on the latest research papers instead of a standard text book, lectures are based on interaction and discussion instead of just “lecturing”, many of the quizzes and problem sets are actually open research problems and most of all it is fun! The instructor and the TFs are here to help you every day and at all times throughout the semester. You may request as many meetings as you like and as much help as you want.

                    The course is also geared towards engaging creative thinking and problem solving to give students a feeling of how computer science research takes place. Many of our students in the past have successfully engaged in research projects with DASlab and published research papers.

                <h3>How much work is it?</h3>
                <p>
                    You may have heard stories about CS165 and wondering if DS5110 is going to be equally hard or you may have taken CS165 and wondering if this is going to be a similar amount of work. CS165 and DS5110 are different style of classes. While CS165 is much more focused on implementation leading to a full system prototype, DS5110 is more focused on ideas and design. In other words, you may have written 5-10K lines of code (some even more!) for CS165 but in DS5110 you are more likely going to write small amounts of code and mostly play with alternative ways to design a specific functionality, structure or algorithm to highlight the effect of different choices and to find out new ways to solve a specific problem.

                <h3>Lectures</h3>
                <p>
                    This class meets once per week.
                    More info can be found on the lectures page.

            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Interaction in Every Class</h3>
                <p>
                    While the instructor will do a few lectures through the semester, the class is going to be primarily discussion based. Think of this as an extended brainstorming session, a round table discussion about a specific problem in each class. The goal is to create the maximum possible interaction.

                    Our discussion will aim at bringing up design trends and tradeoffs, as well as algorithmic issues. Another significant part of our discussions will focus on examining open problems and to highlight opportunities for innovation.

                    At the very beginning of the semester the instructor will do 5-6 lectures to provide the necessary background. After that, each class will be based on a student presentation about a recent research paper which will work as a trigger for the day’s brainstorming. Depending on the needs of the class, the instructor will do additional lectures during class time or during our extra research sessions.

            <div id="oh-lab">
                <h3>Office Hours & Labs</h3>
                <p>
                    Interaction does not stop at lecture time. DS5110 is designed to maximize interaction as we truly believe this is the best way to learn; we offer daily office hours and labs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Starting Week 1, Prof. Fox and TAs will hold office hours during the week and additional  times periodically during the weekend. Labs are offered by the TAs. The goal of labs is to get hands-on help for the projects (coding). Bring your your questions about specific project parts you need help with. Labs are the place to go when you have a persistent bug, when you need help with a specific tool for the project (e.g., for debugging or performance testing) or to get feedback about the quality of your coding.

                <h3>Attendance</h3>
                <p>
                    Based on the philosophy of the course, attendance in lectures and labs. Office hours is optional. The best way to learn, though, is through discussion and interaction with the instructor and the TAs. Our classes are not about “lecturing” - they are about interaction. We hope to see you there!

                <h3>Lecture Recordings</h3>
                <p>
                    All classes and interactive sessions in class will be recorded and will be available online. So even if you miss a class it will be easy to catch up and you can also use these recordings to recite specific material throughout the semester (e.g., to prepare for midterms).

                <h3>Sections</h3>
                <p>
                    Another component of the course is sections. Sections are used to deliver material about the class, i.e., to go more deeply into some of the concepts discussed in class, to do additional quizzes, or to deliver background material that is needed to follow next week’s class or for the project. There will be no actual section meeting. Instead, all sections will be recored by the teaching staff and videos will be posted online. The material posted will be tailored to present a step by step guide for any of the topics presented to make it easy to follow everything without having to be physically present in an actual section. However, if there are still questions about the material presented in sections, you will be able to ask those questions either during the daily office hours and labs.

                    Throughout the semester, on select days the instructor, and DASlab PhDs and postdocs, will discuss about research! First, DASlab researchers will present their recent work on data systems research and connect it with the material you are learning in class. Then, you will get the chance to talk with them about their research, open problems and be exposed to open research opportunities. Snacks and drinks will be provided.

                <h3>Weekly Reviews</h3>
                <p>
                    Each student will provide two paper reviews per week. This prepares you to be ready for the discussion in class. Reviews should be no more than two page long.
                    Each review should have text for at least the following 9 points:
                </p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                    <li>What is the problem?</li>
                    <li>Why is it important?</li>
                    <li>Why is it hard?</li>
                    <li>Why do existing solutions not work?</li>
                    <li>What is the core intuition for the solution?</li>
                    <li>Does the paper prove its claims?</li>
                    <li>What is the setup of analysis/experiments? is it sufficient?</li>
                    <li>Are there any gaps in the logic/proof?</li>
                    <li>What are next steps?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Reviews should be no more than two pages long. PDF. Single column. 8pt font. 1 inch margins. Submission will be through Canvas. The deadline for each paper review is the starting time of the respective class. This is a hard deadline. The first four reviews will not be graded; we will use them only to provide feedback on the quality of the review and the grade that this review would get. Every second week we will have a special OH meeting to review the student reviews.

            <div id="presentations">
                <h3>Presentations</h3>
                <p>
                    Each student will do at least one paper presentation during the semester. Presentations should follow similar guidelines as the guidelines for reviews. There should be 1-2 slides for each one of the nine core points in the review guidelines. In addition, there should be detailed slides that describe the core idea of the paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your slides should not be a multiple sheets of bullet lists - in fact try to avoid bullet lists altogether - your slides should follow the generic formatting you will see in the first four lectures, that is: make slides as simple as possible - avoid text unless absolutely needed - no full phrases unless you need to give an
                    exact definition of something - use figures and visual examples, one slide one message=each slide should have a single goal that you
                    should be able to describe within a single phrase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your slides should be reviewed by the instructor at least 24 hours before the class you are presenting.  The final deck of slides should
                    be available 30 minutes before class so we can upload online. You are welcome to join for OH for help >>1 while you prepare your slides!

                <p>
                    Background: Naturally, the more background you have the smoother your experience in DS5110 will be. Prior knowledge of Python programming and systems programming, as well as a good understanding of computer architecture and in particular the memory hierarchy (cache memories) is very important for this class. Courses providing systems background (like DS and in particular DS or equivalent) are essential. Good hacking, algorithm designing, and data structures skills are also required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are graduate student and have taken a mix of systems (database, operating and distributed systems) classes in the past, then you will be OK and we will provide enough background so you can follow. DS5110 does satisfy the systems requirement towards a PhD.

                    Just utilize all resources provided. Show up in class to participate in interactive sessions. There are also daily office hours and labs; show up as often as possible so we can help with anything you need! When you find yourself stuck with the project either with a design decision or just a bug, it is normal to struggle for a while — it is part of the learning process — but after some time grab your laptop and come by!

                    Especially if you have not taken CS165 it is a good idea to spend some time preparing before the semester starts and during the early weeks of the semester even if you consider yourself an expert systems student. The best approach is to browse some fundamental readings in data systems architectures. We propose that you take a look at the following texts from the CS165 readings:

                <h3>Semester Project</h3>
                <p>
                    Each student completes a semester project. There are two kinds of semester projects:
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                        <li>a systems project, and</li>
                        <li>a research project</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Systems projects are tailored to provide background on state-of-the-art systems, data structures and algorithms. They include a design component and an implementation component in Python or Java, dealing with low level systems issues such as memory management, hardware conscious processing, parallel processing, managing read/write tradeoffs and scalability. This year’s systems project is about designing and implementing a key-value store in the form of a Log Structured Tree that can accommodate fast reads and writes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The research project, on the other hand, is much more tailored on design and proof of concept implementations trying to solve open problems. Research projects are tailored to give a taste of research to students and lead to publications. When working on a research project, students will work closely with the instructor and members of DASlab on active research projects of the lab. Students will work on groups of three. Such projects are mainly about thinking, reading and writing and  much  less  about  coding  although  proof  of  concept implementations will be our end target in some cases.This year we will be working on the following research projects: 1) Self-designing NoSQL Key-value stores, 2) The Periodic Table of Data Structures, 3) Fast Neural Networks, 4) Adaptive Blockchain, and 5) Image Storage for AI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research projects will be offered to students who have taken CS165 in the past and students who already have a significant systems background. This will be done in consultation with the instructor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In special cases where a student wants to work on an alternative research project, i.e., a project which is inspired by existing research that the student is already doing (e.g., as part of a PhD for a grad student or a continuation of the CS165 project for an undergrad) we will work to accommodate such requests on a case by case basis. This will be done in consultation with the instructor and only if students probably would not benefit from doing a systems project as they know this material already. Assuming there is a strong plan and drive for a specific project, such requests will most likely be granted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Systems project can evolve into research projects throughout the semester for students that progress fast and want to continue with research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is a successful project? For systems projects we will give out specific functionality and performance metrics you have to achieve as part of the description of the project. For research projects we will give out specific questions you need to answer when we set-up each individual research project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Evaluation: There is no final or midterms. At the end of the semester each student will have a meeting with the instructor and another meeting with the TFs where students will demonstrate their projects and answer design questions about the project. [Tip: Past experience shows that frequent participation in office hours, brainstorming sessions and sections means that the instructor and the TFs are very well aware of your system and your progress which makes the final evaluation a mere formality for these cases.]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Collaboration policy: The systems project is an individual project: the final deliverable should be personal, you must write from scratch all the code of your system and all documentation and reports. Discussing the design and implementation problems with other students is allowed and encouraged! We will do so in the class and during office hours and brainstorming sessions. Research projects are going to be in groups of three and similar to the systems project we encourage discussions across teams but in the end each team should deliver a project that is clearly theirs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Late days policy: All projects are due at the end of the semester and this is when they will be graded. The more input you give us, through the semester though, the more we can help you learn. In the systems project description you can find a detailed time- schedule that we propose you follow. Similarly, we will set up specific timelines for each research project. All timelines represent an ideal plan and you have the freedom to adjust according to your schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are no late days for reviews. This is because reviews are essential for you to follow each class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: Experience says that every year a number of students cannot handle the freedom to self-pace, and end up significantly deviating from the schedule. We will send you frequent reminders but you should know that deviating from the schedule by more than a couple of weeks will most likely mean that you will not be able to finish the whole project by the end of the semester (unless you are an experienced systems student).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Midway Check-in: The goal here is to demonstrate that you are having decent progress and mainly to avoid falling behind. By early March each student working on a systems project should deliver 1) a design document and 2) one performance experiment that demonstrates an early result (10%). A template of the expected design document will be provided early in the semester.

                <h3>Guest Lectures</h3>
                <p>
                    Every semester we arrange a few guest lectures by leaders in data system design from industry and academia. Past guest lecturers in our classes include: Guy Lohman from IBM Research, Erietta Liarou from EPFL Lausanne, Alkis Simitsis and Georgia Koutrika from HP Labs, Nikita Shamgunov from MemSQL, Laura Haas from IBM Research, Nga Tran from Vertica, Jignesh Patel from University of Wisconsin, Johannes Gherke, from Microsoft, Marcin Zukowski from Snowflake, Richard Hipp from SQLite, Ryan Johnson from Logicblox.
                    You will get the opportunity to both attend a guest lecture and to actively participate in discussions with our guest speakers.

                <p>
                    We welcome feedback and ideas about the course at any point during the semester. Just come and chat with us during office hours! Tell us how you are keeping up and how we can make it easier for you. 
                    We provide feedback continuously. The main thing that you will need feedback on is your semester project and the paper reviews. The way to get feedback is to show up to our daily office hours and labs and share your design decisions, code, and test results with the staff or ask us to go with you over your paper reviews. In this way, you will get hands-on help and feedback. Specifically for reviews we will hold a special session every second week to “review the reviews”.

                <p>
                    We will use ED Discussions as a forum for online discussions. The links are posted on the class website. You are welcome to post any question that might help you understand the material better or help you with the project. Anonymous posting (to other students) will be enabled so that students feel more comfortable posting.

                    BASIC RULES: We only have a few basic rules so we can keep the forum functional and useful for the students as well as manageable for the staff.
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                        <li>We ask that you first search the forum well before posting a question so that we do not have duplicate entries.</li>
                        <li>Please make sure to stay on top of all Instructor/TA posts (especially those that are pinned). Anything we post at the forum we consider “known”.</li>
                        <li>Do not use the forum to post code or ask for help with debugging. While it can work in some cases remote debugging is a pain and takes a lot of time. We have labs every week. Join remotely and we will help you via a shared screen mode.</li>
                        <li>Do not use the forum for anything that is not about a technical question or a question about class logistics. If you want to discuss any concerns about your progress, fit for the class, or anything else you should come to office hours.</li>

                    DS5110 is a heavily hands-on and research oriented course that is structured in a very different way than other classes, valuing and promoting critical thinking. For most students this requires a transitions phase. Please check the syllabus and requirements carefully before committing to this course.

                    In addition, keep in mind that taking this course successfully will in practice require participation in Lab sessions. Tthey are critical for students to understand how to think about the material and how to design solutions. Especially if you do not have all the background described in the syllabus (i.e., if you have not taken a research oriented systems course with a heavy systems project), you should budget time for frequent participation in both Labs and office hours and many hours of additional work every week to build the foundations needed.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lecture: All lectures will be broadcasted live. Lectures will also be available for on- demand broadcast within 24 hours after each class. Students will be able to watch the live or recorded broadcast through their browser. The link to the broadcasts for DS5110 will be available through the canvas website for this class and will also be posted on the class website before the first lecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Participation: Extension school students will be able to participate live in classes, office hours and labs via web-conference tools (we will use Zoom). The course staff will be online with Zoom during each session that is marked as “remote” and you will be able to actively interact with the staff. Other than standard chatting and talking features Zoom also offers screen sharing features which can be used for when you need help with specific issues such as debugging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grading: Even though we encourage extension school students to utilize the opportunity to interact with the staff and participate in class live we know that for practical reasons this will not be possible for all remote students. For this reason for extension school students there will be no “class participation” grade. The rest of the course is exactly the same as what local students do. For this reason the portion of the class participation grade (20%) will be distributed to other class components and the final grade break down is as follows: project (50%), presentation (20%) and reviews (20%). The 10% for the midway check-in completes the grade distribution for extension school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Discussion Forum: Given that remote students have usually a different set of needs due to the distance, there is a separate forum tailored to extension school. Look at the class website for the forum link for extension school students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Office Hours and Labs: Extension school OH and Labs take place remotely during the weekend, which is typically more convenient for most students. In this way, we can have more flexibility to accommodate students with day jobs that cannot attend during the week. The schedule will be posted at the beginning of the semester on the class website and the forum.
